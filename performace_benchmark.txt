Execution time for 1000*146 movies -> Mean 10 times

1. version: 31.49 ms -> ORIGINAL
2. version: 33.82 ms -> With for..of instead of forEach
3. version: 30.90 ms -> With new Set(genres)

CONSIDERATIONS:

Even though forEach is suposedly less performant than for..of, it didn't show any significant difference. Actually,
forEach proved to be slightly better than for..of, so I decided to use forEach.

I have transformed the array argument `genres` to a Set, which is theoretically better for 
indexing. However, the improvement was very small and it may not be significative.
